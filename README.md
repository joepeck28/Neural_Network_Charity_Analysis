# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Project Overview
Should a specific charity receive funding based on the predictions of a Neural Net Model? Our dataset contained information for over 34,000 organizations. The first step was to drop any non-pertinent rows, then combining or binning data in columns where there are many unique values, and encoding categorical columns. Next splitting the data into training and validation sets and then scaling the data are performed. 
The neural network uses the Tensorflow Keras library and is evaluated using the loss and accuracy metrics.
